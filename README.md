This work was conducted as part of a <b><font color='green'>US Department of Energy SCGSR Fellowship</font></b> ([details](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr)) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory with additional support from the <b><font color='DodgerBlue'>US National Science Foundation</font></b> ([grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2132183&HistoricalAwards=false)).

## Current Purpose

The current version has been modified to:
1. Process batches of DNA sequences rapidly.
2. Enhance compatibility with Google Colab for improved accessibility and ease of use.
3. Optimize the output format for simple analysis.

These modifications aim to streamline the process of analyzing and optimizing large sets of DNA sequences, making it more efficient for researchers working with bulk genomic data.

## Original Purpose

This repository originally contained source for the following:
- TIsigner command line version (TIsigner_cmd).
- TIsigner website (TIsigner_web).

## Original Research and Publications

This paper describes [TIsigner](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009461).

## Installation Instructions

Instructions for setting up the modified command line version and using it with Google Colab are available in the TIsigner_cmd directory.
